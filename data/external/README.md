> The *United Nations' Finance Center for South-South Cooperation* maintains arguably the 
world's most reputable and reliable list of Global South countries. 
As of early 2022, the list includes 78 countries in all, which are referred to as the *"Group of 77 and China."*

> the G77 has expanded significantly, and today it includes 134 member countries. 
However, the group has kept its original name for historical and symbolic reasons, 
as "G77" represents the unity and foundation of the group when it first began.
